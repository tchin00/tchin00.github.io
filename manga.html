			<p> In his past life, although too weak to protect his home when it counted, out of grave determination Nie Li became the strongest Demon Spiritist and stood at the pinnacle of the martial world. However, he lost his life during the battle with the Sage Emperor and six deity-ranked beasts. His soul was then brought back to when he was still 13 years old. Although he's the weakest in his class with the lowest talent, having only a red soul realm and a weak one at that, with the aid of the vast knowledge which he accumulated from his previous life, he decided to train faster than anyone could expect. He also decided to help those who died nobly in his previous life to train faster as well. He aims to protect the city from the coming future of being devastated by demon beasts and the previous fate of ending up destroyed. He aims to protect his lover, friends, family and fellow citizens who died in the beast assault or its aftermath. And he aims to destroy the so-called Sacred family who arrogantly abandoned their duty and betrayed the city in his past life. <a href="https://mangapark.me/manga/tales-of-demons-and-gods-mad-snail"> Read here. </a> </p> 
			<li id="titles"> <h3> Bleach </h3> </li>
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7FDvfzk.jpg"> </img>
			<p> Bleach follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper, a death personification similar to the Grim Reaperâ€”from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. What the Bleach manga attracted us is not the novel lot, but the interpretation about the fate of Ichigo Kurosaki, a young who stay with the sad memories. The Bleach tried to outline the story out with a lot of memories and dialogues, slowly but implicative.

			<img src="https://www.anime-planet.com/images/anime/covers/fullmetal-alchemist-437.jpg"> </img>
			<p> In an alchemical transmutation gone wrong, Edward Elric lost his right arm and his left leg, and his brother Alphonse lost his entire body, ending up as nothing but a soul in an empty suit of armor. Equipped with mechanical "automail" limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist of the military and starts a long journey across the nation of Amestris along with his brother, trying to restore their bodies to their original shape by finding the so-called Philosopher's Stone, which is said to give an alchemist the ability to overlook the law of Equivalent Exchange. At first the Elric brothers have that one goal in mind, however, as their journey continues they find themselves fighting for something that is much, much greater than they could have ever imagined.
